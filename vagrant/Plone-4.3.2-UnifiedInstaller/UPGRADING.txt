Major Version Upgrades
======================

Upgrading from Plone 2.x to Plone 4
-----------------------------------

You will nearly always want to upgrade your Plone 2.x installation first to a
working Plone 3.3.x installation, then attempt the Plone 4 upgrade. Upgrades
of very old installations will nearly always require add-on-product problem
solving.

Upgrading from Plone 3.0 or 3.1
-------------------------------

Plone installations before 3.2 generally did not use the zc.buildout
configuration management system. See
http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/general-advice-on-updating-from-a-non-buildout-to-buildout-based-installation
for an orientation to buildout and advice on the update pattern.

Upgrading from Plone 3.2 or later
---------------------------------

The general strategy for this upgrade path is to:

1) Independently install Plone 4;

2) Get all of your add-on products working on your new Plone 4 install;
   This will usually involve adding new product version specifications
   to the "eggs" list of the Plone 4 install. If you're upgrading a
   custom product, see 
   http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/version/upgrading-plone-3-x-to-4.0/updating-add-on-products-for-plone-4.0
   
3) Copy the Data.fs database file from your old to var/filestorage in your
   new install. Restart Zope and run the portal migration to update database
   entries to new formats.
   
Upgrading from an earlier Plone 4
---------------------------------

You probably do not need a new installation. Instead, follow the
instructions in your buildout.cfg file for switching your version
configuration file to use the latest available.

Make sure you back up your complete installation before running
any in-place update!
